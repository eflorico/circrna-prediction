hsa_hg19_Rybak2015: Genomic loci of circRNAs (positive samples)
                    Blocks are probably exons - what to use - see course
all_exons.bed:      Genomic loci of exons (negative samples, when not overlapped with circRNAs)
hg19_Alu.bed:       Bonus 1
hg19.fa:            Reference genome
                    Ignore weird sequences
                    Q: N, lower case?
                    Soft/hard masking? Repeats?
